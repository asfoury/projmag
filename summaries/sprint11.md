# Summary for sprint 11


## Mohamed 


## Giovanni (Scrum Master)
This week I finish my task Notification this take me more time then expeted, because I spent a lot of time on the requested changes, and had a 
problem with how to store properly the server key

## Luke


## Arnaud


## Kaourintin


## Paul
This week I finish implementing Dagger Hilt in our code base. It took me two weeks to do this, but it seems that it was worth it, as all the testing and access to our services are cleaner and easier now. This should have been achieved earlier as we would have been far more productive.
I need to get more used to the error reporting of the Hilt framework, and also to add more tests

## Overall Team
This sprint we work well and we did 2 stand up meeting, the only problem is as it is the end of the 
semester we have lot of work and it can be difficult to mananage the time between all deadlines
