# Summary for sprint 11


## Mohamed 
This sprint I had two tasks the first was to implement the UI for the comment section and the second, to connect it to firebase, I ended up working 8 hours on the UI of the comment section because it was quite complex. It took multiple tries to get right.

This week I finish implementing Dagger Hilt in our code base. It took me two weeks to do this, but it seems that it was worth it, as all the testing and access to our services are cleaner and easier now. This should have been achieved earlier as we would have been far more productive.
I need to get more used to the error reporting of the Hilt framework, and also to add more tests
