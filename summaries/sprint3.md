# Summary for week 3

## Mohamed

## Giovanni
I made a UI for profile. With this interface user can add their informtions ,name,age,gender and can 
add a profile picture from the gallery. My time estimate for coding the feature was accrute but i spend more time
on merging and fixing bugs. I need next time to add more test in my code because my coverage was low

## Luke (Scrum Master)
I made taken projects be greyed out and at the end of the project list. I ran into some problems doing this, the greying out was inconsistent when I pressed on the search button but I managed to solve this relatively quickly. I also added a profile button next to the search button which leads to the profile page.
I spent roughly 7 hours on my task but overall 10 hours with merging and reviewing.
I need to achieve a better understanding of UI xml files.

## Overall Team
For the most part, we had tasks which we found quite accessible and doable. However we realised that Asfoury had a harder task than the rest of us and spent much more time working on it.
We had 3 stand-up meetings and relatively good communication, given that our tasks were quite independent.
We were unfortunately unable to be ready to merge for Thursday morning.
