# Summary for week 8

## Mohamed
This week I had 2 tasks the first was to fix some issues with the user profile which I initally thought would take me 4 hours and the second was to work on another feature. The fixes ended up taking me more time then expected because I had some issues with tests passing on cirrus and also after each of the 2 code reviews that were done I had some things to fix so this ended up also taking some time. For the next sprints I can try to produce better code from the begining thus minimizing what I have to do after the code reviews and also try to improve my time estimates. The first task took about 8 hours and the code review I did took about 30 minutes.
## Giovanni
This week first I add PHD role as user type to our app , which was a quick and easy task then I update the user type code to allow to save type of the user when the applicaton is turn off. This task take more time then expectd because I had to find the good way to save the user type choice in the documentation.  I don't have enough time to implement my third task. I have to pay attention to the choice of my task and thier time estimation for the next sprint 

## Luke
This week I added a filter which filtered by projects to which the user has applied. This took a bit of trial and error, about 4 hours (rather than the 3 estimated). I also reviewed some pull requests. Working on my second task (of 3), I ran into many unexpected complications. I was trying to make the apply button also send their candidature for the project, which now works, only with dummy profiles and CVs. However unapply does not remove the application. We have determined that we must simplify the implementation of sending the candidature to firebase. I spent about 5 hours on this task. I should have paid more attention to what the task implied in order to better estimate my time.

## Arnaud
This week I added a cached and offline implementation of UserData and Candidature databases.  
I spent less time than expected, mostly because I created some functions that load/save generic type.  
Next sprint, I need to add KDoc and fix the issues from the code review to my code.

## Paul (Scrum Master)
This week I had to implement preferences for projects. This went smoothly. I work a decent amount of time. As we recieved the code review from our TAs, I was able to fix some of my bad coding habits. However I had some issue in testing as Dagger Hilt dependency injection is still not a part of our project.
Next sprint, I hope to work on this dagger hilt stuff.

## Overall Team
Nothing special to say for this sprint. The PR merge were a bit late. Except that we had some issue to find time for stand-up meetings at the beginning of the sprint. However, later, the team was able catch up and meet to solve issues or get help. We also recieved the code review, and the team agreed to define UI tests refactoring (depency injection overall) and KDOC as the highest priority for next sprint.
