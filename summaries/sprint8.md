# Summary for week 8

## Mohamed

## Giovanni
This week first I add PHD role as user type to our app , which was a quick and easy task then I update the user type code to allow to save type of the user when the applicaton is turn off. This task take more time then expectd because I had to find the good way to save the user type choice in the documentation.  I don't have enough time to implement my third task. I have to pay attention to the choice of my task and thier time estimation for the next sprint
