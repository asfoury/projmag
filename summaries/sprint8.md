# Summary for week 8

This week first I add PHD role as user type to our app , which was a quick and easy task then I update the user type code to allow to save type of the user when the applicaton is turn off. This task take more time then expectd because I had to find the good way to save the user type choice in the documentation.  I don't have enough time to implement my third task. I have to pay attention to the choice of my task and thier time estimation for the next sprint

This week I added a filter which filtered by projects to which the user has applied. This took a bit of trial and error, about 4 hours (rather than the 3 estimated). I also reviewed some pull requests. Working on my second task (of 3), I ran into many unexpected complications. I was trying to make the apply button also send their candidature for the project, which now works, only with dummy profiles and CVs. However unapply does not remove the application. We have determined that we must simplify the implementation of sending the candidature to firebase. I spent about 5 hours on this task. I should have paid more attention to what the task implied in order to better estimate my time.
