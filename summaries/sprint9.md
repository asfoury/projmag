## Kaourintin (Scrum Master)
I finished the section part, the favorite feature. I started thinking on how to implement properly local video storing and think that it is a separate task that requires
time. I reviewed two pull requests. I did not start looking at an AR API.

## Overall Team
Our main goals this week was to fix put the necessary kdoc everywhere it was needed from the code review and to finish key features of the app.
We achieved this. The secondary goals were to start adressing dependency injection and start looking at the API's necessary for the disturbance sprint. Due to
lack of time we only did this partially although we have a few PR's on this already.
