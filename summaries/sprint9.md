# Summary for week 9

## Mohamed

## Giovanni

This week first  I add KDoc to some fuction. Then my second task was to find way to have the orientation of the telephone, this take me time to find a good way of to that in the documentation but then the implementation was not hard. For this two task my time estimation was accrute  

## Luke
This week I first added KDoc for the activities and adapter packages. This took a bit longer than expected but was relatively quick. I then implemented the sending of candidatures when one applies to a project. This took roughly the time estimated to implement, despite some problems with implementing the removeCandidature function. However, after merging my code with the main, the unapply feature was no longer working so I spent a few hours debugging that. Overall I am quite happy with my tasks and I spent an appropriate amount of time on them.

## Arnaud
This week I added the date of creation to project.  
I changed the default sorting of the list of projects, now projects are sorted by date, the newest at the top.  
I spent less time than expected for my task, so I also add some missing implementations of database.

## Kaourintin (Scrum Master)
I finished the section part, the favorite feature. I started thinking on how to implement properly local video storing and think that it is a separate task that requires
time. I reviewed two pull requests. I briefly looked at AR APIs and started seeing how to use quickstart library to achieve our goals

## Paul 
This week, I started implementing Dependency Injection, using the Dagger Hilt framework.
I spend most of the time reading the documentation, as some stuff were not introduced in the last semester project.
Then I began modifying the tests of two activities, using these new DI.
Next week, I hope to continue working on this.


## Overall Team
Our main goals this week was to  put the necessary kdoc everywhere it was needed from the code review and to finish key features of the app.
We achieved this. The secondary goals were to start adressing dependency injection and start looking at the APIs necessary for the disturbance sprint. Due to
lack of time we only did this partially although we have a few PR's on this already.
