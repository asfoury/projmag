Improved the tagsbase. I actually spent a lot of time on the computer trying to understand my UI tasks but I just didn't manage to focus and wasted it. Work discipline is going down a blackhole need to find a solution to it. For next week I need to catch up this week's work and also manage the tasks that are given to me better.
