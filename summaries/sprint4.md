# Summary for week 3

## Mohamed(Scrum Master)

## Giovanni
I allow user to add a video from gallery to the cv. I spent a lot of time to search how to use gallery and video api on android studio and to seach how to test the selection on th
gallery. I need next time to add more test in my code because my coverage was low

## Luke 
I have implemented deep linking. This has taken much more time than estimated. I have run into many issues. I configured the Firebase project to allow deep linking. I implemented the necessary dependencies, but these at first would not resolve. I then added the code necessary to manage a deep link but this was just caused the application to crash initially. I have spent roughly 10 hours on this task, even though it was estimated at 4, and that I could also perform another task during this sprint. I will undertake my remaining task next sprint along with another.

Improved the tagsbase. I actually spent a lot of time on the computer trying to understand my UI tasks but I just didn't manage to focus and wasted it. Work discipline is going down a blackhole need to find a solution to it. For next week I need to catch up this week's work and also manage the tasks that are given to me better.
