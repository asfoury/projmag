This week I continued and finished the setup for Hilt dependency injection.
I also tested my setup my implementing DI for the PreferencesActivity, which is working.

I had a lot of difficulties, by adapting other activities as the I didn't understand well when Dependency Injections where injected or bound with another value in tests. Next week I'll need to learn more about the unexpected behaviours of the Hilt framework.
