I added more tests to my last week task. 

I also begin my new task which was to setup a favorites Collection on firebase, which stores user's favorite projects. Then I setup a interface and implementation of it to interract with this newly created collection. Everything went flawlessly except, that Mockito has some issue with some Firebase class.
