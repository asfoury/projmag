# Summary for week 2

## Mohamed
I made the projects clickable and they now open a new activity with the details of the project and the user can go back to the list of projects from the new activity.

## Giovanni
I add a checkbox to allow stutend to choose their favorite project.

## Luke
I added search UI to the projects list activity and implemented the search function.

## Arnaud
I added a cached version of the ProjectDatabase, then I use most of my times writting tests and modifying my code. (to change from temporary Project type, to new one).

## Kaourintin 
I improved the project type by making it totally immutable and easier to create slightly modified copies and changed it to make it easier to incorporate it into other people's code. I added tags to the project (for now as a simple string list) 

## Paul (Scrum Master)
I added more tests to my last week task. 

I also begin my new task which was to setup a favorites Collection on firebase, which stores user's favorite projects. Then I setup a interface and implementation of it to interract with this newly created collection. Everything went flawlessly except, that Mockito has some issue with some Firebase class.

I need to get more familiar with the scrum board, and UI testing.

## Overall Team
The team took realize that last sprint was not a good one, and worked hard to put the project back on track.

We are getting more ease with the Scrum metodology. We did a stand up meeting each day, tracking the progress of each member an their difficulties.

However we are still in hurry, and the final result (even though it is working) is not as polished as we wanted.
