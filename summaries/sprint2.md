# Summary for week 2

## Mohamed
I made the projects clickable and they now open a new activity with the details of the project and the user can go back to the list of projects from the new activity.

## Giovanni

## Luke

## Arnaud
I added a cached version of the ProjectDatabase, then I use most of my times writting tests and modifying my code. (to change from temporary Project type, to new one).

## Kaourintin 
I improved the project type by making it totally immutable and easier to create slightly modified copies and changed it to make it easier to incorporate it into other people's code. I added tags to the project (for now as a simple string list) 
## Paul (Scrum Master)
I added more tests to my last week task. 

I also begin my new task which was to setup a favorites Collection on firebase, which stores user's favorite projects. Then I setup a interface and implementation of it to interract with this newly created collection. Everything went flawlessly except, that Mockito has some issue with some Firebase class.
