# Summary for week 2

I added a cached version of the ProjectDatabase, then I use most of my times writting tests and modifying my code. (to change from temporary Project type, to new one).

## Kaourintin 

## Paul (Scrum Master)
I added more tests to my last week task. 

I also begin my new task which was to setup a favorites Collection on firebase, which stores user's favorite projects. Then I setup a interface and implementation of it to interract with this newly created collection. Everything went flawlessly except, that Mockito has some issue with some Firebase class.
