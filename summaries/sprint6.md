# Summary for week 6

## Mohamed

## Giovanni
This week I improve the pathing between diffrent activity in the projet, alow user to create a profil when they connected for the first time. This task take me more time than expected because I had to try to solve a bug of pathing with deep linking. I don't have enough time to implement 
my second task which is make a clear distinction between student and teacher user.

## Arnaud (Scrum Master)
I added a Waiting list UI for teacher that display all candidatures to a specific project, where they can accept/reject students.  
I change how "Utils" (object with databases) is instancied for allowing dummy databases for testing.  
It took me more time than estimated, because I also add the firebase implementation for candidatures.

## Kaourintin 
I finished the tagUI merge of last week, Did a massive refactor to improve readability and did my task of this week on the section model and UI, I also made sure that it is updated on firebase.
It took me a bit more over eight hours (ten or more) but I expected it. 
For next week, I want to be given time to polish the UI and solve stuff that I have identified to be ugly/unwieldy.
## Paul
This sprint, I had two task, but due to difficulties in testing I only finished one.
I added the ability to play subtiles, and to show a message that tell the user how to setup their device for subtitling. The implementation went well. However testing was more difficult as I experienced some wierd behavior with dialog in tests. I also had coverage issues.
I expect to begin and finish my next task (improving project filtering) in the next sprint.



## Overall Team
We had some problems about tasks that were nearly impossible to be finished this week.  
For example automatic subtitles (not only speech-to-text, but timed text), or firebases rules (we were still modifying firestore structures, so rules would break our code).  
We did 4 standup meetings, but we were quite short on time to finish and merge our tasks.  
Next time we should try to select tasks that are really currently realizable.
