# Summary for week 6

I added a Waiting list UI for teacher that display all candidatures to a specific project, where they can accept/reject students.  
I change how "Utils" (object with databases) is instancied for allowing dummy databases for testing.  
It took me more time than estimated, because I also add the firebase implementation for candidatures.

This sprint, I had two task, but due to difficulties in testing I only finished one.
I added the ability to play subtiles, and to show a message that tell the user how to setup their device for subtitling. The implementation went well. However testing was more difficult as I experienced some wierd behavior with dialog in tests. I also had coverage issues.
I expect to begin and finish my next task (improving project filtering) in the next sprint.



## Overall Team
We had some problems about tasks that were nearly impossible to be finished this week.  
For example automatic subtitles (not only speech-to-text, but timed text), or firebases rules (we were still modifying firestore structures, so rules would break our code).  
We did 4 standup meetings, but we were quite short on time to finish and merge our tasks.  
Next time we should try to select tasks that are really currently realizable.
