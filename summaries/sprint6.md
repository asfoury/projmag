# Summary for week 6

## Mohamed
This week I had to connect the UI of the users profile to firebase this was my first time using firebase so it took me more time than I expected and I did not have
the time to write tests, I started learning how to use mockito but was not able to implement the tests before the end of the sprint, I worked about 9 hours on my task. Next time I think that I will spend a lot less time when using Firebase as I now understand how to work with it.
## Giovanni
This week I improve the pathing between diffrent activity in the projet, alow user to create a profil when they connected for the first time. This task take me more time than expected because I had to try to solve a bug of pathing with deep linking. I don't have enough time to implement 
my second task which is make a clear distinction between student and teacher user.

## Luke 
Initially I set out to implement automatic subtitles on videos but this proved more complicated than forseen. It would have taken a very significant amount of time for a feature not particularly important to the application. I therefore changed tasks and corrected a bug regarding the deep linking feature and made projects clickable (rather than their titles). I then added the ability to upload a CV created in the application to Firebase. This was a relatively small amount of time but took me a significant amount of time, as I had not previously dealt with uploading to the Firestore. Arnaud helped me to understand how to do this. Overall I spent roughly 9 hours on my tasks this week.

## Arnaud (Scrum Master)
I added a Waiting list UI for teacher that display all candidatures to a specific project, where they can accept/reject students.  
I change how "Utils" (object with databases) is instancied for allowing dummy databases for testing.  
It took me more time than estimated, because I also add the firebase implementation for candidatures.

## Kaourintin 
I finished the tagUI merge of last week, Did a massive refactor to improve readability and did my task of this week on the section model and UI, I also made sure that it is updated on firebase.
It took me a bit more over eight hours (ten or more) but I expected it. 
For next week, I want to be given time to polish the UI and solve stuff that I have identified to be ugly/unwieldy.

## Paul
This sprint, I had two task, but due to difficulties in testing I only finished one.
I added the ability to play subtiles, and to show a message that tell the user how to setup their device for subtitling. The implementation went well. However testing was more difficult as I experienced some wierd behavior with dialog in tests. I also had coverage issues.
I expect to begin and finish my next task (improving project filtering) in the next sprint.

## Overall Team
We had some problems about tasks that were nearly impossible to be finished this week.  
For example automatic subtitles (not only speech-to-text, but timed text), or firebases rules (we were still modifying firestore structures, so rules would break our code).  
We did 4 standup meetings, but we were quite short on time to finish and merge our tasks.  
Next time we should try to select tasks that are really currently realizable.
