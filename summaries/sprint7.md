# Summary for week 7

## Mohamed
This week I had to finish last weeks PR(needed to use mockito to write tests and improve code coverage) and also work on QR generation for the projects, I was able to do both but the 2 PRs wont pass the android tests on Cirrus despite passing before and passing locally. I am not sure what to do, this sprint my time estimates were corrcect for the implememtation of the new feature and for the tests, but I ended up working about 15 hours with a large part dedicated to trying different things to make the tests pass on Cirrus. I am not sure what to do maybe try to use the same emulator that is used on Cirrus?

## Luke (Scrum Master)
This week I added the apply/unapply feature to the app. I also set out to and spent a lot of time trying to enable the display of the list of projects applied to. I however realised that Paul is already creating a filter interface, so we decided that we would integrate the two. I had trouble testing my code and even a basic test would not work until I remembered the system's emulator screen is small. I also review a few PRs. I spent an overall 11hrs this week.


## Arnaud 
This week I added the possibility for teachers to view the list of candidatures for their projects.  
I also fix a bug where projects were not always displayed when the phone was in offline mode.  
I spent a lot of time writing tests and doing code reviews.

## Paul
This week, I added a feature that allows user to filter the list project according to some criteria (currently the required degree : bachelor or master). The design as been made such that it is easy to new criteria without modifying the list or adapter it self.
I had some minor issue, but it was not a big deal.

I worked a little bit more than 8h on this feature.


## Overall Team
This week, most tasks are finished but people seem to have spent quite a bit more than 8 hours on their tasks. Communication was good! We had 3 stand up meetings. Just as in the previous weeks, we really need to finish our tasks earlier so that we do not merge everything late.
