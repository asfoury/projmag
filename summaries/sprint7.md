# Summary for week 6

This week I added the apply/unapply feature to the app. I also set out to and spent a lot of time trying to enable the display of the list of projects applied to. I however realised that Paul is already creating a filter interface, so we decided that we would integrate the two. I had trouble testing my code and even a basic test would not work until I remembered the system's emulator screen is small. I also review a few PRs. I spent an overall 11hrs this week.

## Overall Team
This week, most tasks are finished but people seem to have spent quite a bit more than 8 hours on their tasks. Communication was good! We had 3 stand up meetings. Just as in the previous weeks, we really need to finish our tasks earlier so that we do not merge everything late.
