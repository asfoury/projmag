# Summary for week 6

This week I split UI to have to diffrent interface for student and professor, allow user to access diffrent functionality depend on if there are student and professor (when the user first sign). This task take me more time than expected, I don't have enough time to implement my second task which is create list of own projects available offline

## Luke 
This week I added the apply/unapply feature to the app. I also set out to and spent a lot of time trying to enable the display of the list of projects applied to. I however realised that Paul is already creating a filter interface, so we decided that we would integrate the two. I had trouble testing my code and even a basic test would not work until I remembered the system's emulator screen is small. I also review a few PRs. I spent an overall 11hrs this week.
