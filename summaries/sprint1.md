# Summary for week 1

## Mohamed
I implemented the user interface that shows the list of projects, it took about 8 hours, I was unable to test the view as I was not sure how to test.

## Giovanni

## Luke

## Arnaud
I created the Firebase project and setup all dependencies. It took me less than 3 hours. After finishing my task, I started reading documentations about firebase.

## Kaourintin (Scrum Master)

## Paul
I created an Interface for a Database of `Project`s and also an implementation of it using FireStore from Firebase, which required some time reading the FireStore API documentation. The base code is present an functional, but I still need to write tests (if possible as it has strong external dependencies). It took me way more than the estimated 8h, until now.
