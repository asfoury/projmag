# Summary for week 1

## Mohamed
I implemented the user interface that shows the list of projects, it took about 8 hours, I was unable to test the view as I was not sure how to test.

## Giovanni

## Luke
I implemented the sign in UI, connected it to the Google API to enable a log in with Google and made it such that the app opens to the project list if already signed in, otherwise it goes to the sign in page which then leads to the project list. It took me longer than the estimated 8 hours, approximately 10 hours.

## Arnaud
I created the Firebase project and setup all dependencies. It took me less than 3 hours. After finishing my task, I started reading documentations about firebase.

## Kaourintin (Scrum Master)

## Paul
I created an Interface for a Database of `Project`s and also an implementation of it using FireStore from Firebase, which required some time reading the FireStore API documentation. The base code is present an functional, but I still need to write tests (if possible as it has strong external dependencies). It took me way more than the estimated 8h, until now.
