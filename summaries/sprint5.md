# Summary for week 5

This week , first  I finish my task of last week which was to allow user to use camera to add a video to their Cv. Then I implemented a classe to separate profile user of student and professor. My main problem with the first task was the coverage of testing because I can't find a way of testing the code for recording a video with camera. My time estimation was accurate for the first task but for the second I take less time then expected.

This week, I finished my previous task, which was adding videos to the project information view and HTML support for description.  
I also fixed some bugs such as the app crashing if a project was invalid, and add some tests.

This week, I finished my task of last week, which was to push a project with its video to Firebase.
I also started and finished my first task for this week which was implementing an activity to add subtitling to a video. Currently this activity is only used by the Form activity to subtitle a project presentation video.
I couldn't begin my second (smaller) task, which was fetching subtitle and playing a video with them, as my first task took me way more than 8h. However, it is partially done as I have to play video with subtitles, so that the user has feed back when creating them.

I had to read a lot of documentation on the best way to add subtitle and then how to format them (using the WEBVTT format). The difficult part was to debug the error in formatting the subtitles, so that the video view is able to decode them.
I wish I had the time to implement subtitling in multiple language.

Next week, I'll need to take smaller task with better time estimates.
